\begin{abstract}
We present a queuing model and first \gls{DES} results for \gls{E2E} lag in networked and cloud computer games. \gls{E2E} lag describes the latency between a user's action and the display of the action's results on the screen, thus providing a \gls{QoE} metric for interactivity. In contrast to models that focus on the network \gls{RTT}, we also factor in the game's tickrate and framerate (and codec latencies in the case of cloud games).
% The model's formalism allows us to deduce a few fundamental 
% relationships between the parameters.
We use the model to explore the parameter space, and explain how desynchronization effects between the server tickrate and the game framerate severely impact the \gls{E2E} lag, even up to the point that network delay is entirely masked by other lag contributions. This helps to put into perspective existing literature that uses questionably low framerates and only focuses on network parameters to study game \gls{QoE}.
