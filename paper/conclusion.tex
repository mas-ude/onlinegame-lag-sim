\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The complex interactions of the game ticks and the framerate combined with the high demands on real-time interactivity make video games a very interesting but also challenging topic for objective \gls{QoE} and \gls{QoS} studies. In order to advance this field this paper examined these game mechanics and their implications for online video game measurement approaches. In the future we plan to provide more detailled models of the framerate and tickrate interactions.
