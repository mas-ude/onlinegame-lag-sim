\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The end-to-end lag is a crucial element for the experienced quality of video games. The creation of an abstract model to this lag was the task of this paper. Understanding and modeling the contributing lag factors can build a necessary foundation in order to conduct meaningful subjective user game studies. Additionally, user studies could even be avoided altogether if a good mapping from the end-to-end lag and other basic factors to a \gls{QoE} metric can be derived. 

Of special interest to the \gls{QoE} research community is probably the masking effect low values of the framerate or tickrate have over the network delay on the end-to-end lag. This and similar side effect need to be considered for future research efforts.

This work leaves a lot of room for future work, as just the most fundamental model has been introduced here. Much more effort needs to be spent on fleshing out and testing the game classification criteria for example. But once this has been done, such game categories can fulfill a critical purpose for testing video games in conjunction with proper models for basic game behavior, like the end-to-end lag in the example of this publication.
