\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The end-to-end lag is a crucial element for the experienced quality of video games. The creation of an abstract model to this lag was the task of this paper. Understanding and modeling the contributing lag factors can build a necessary foundation in order to conduct meaningful subjective user game studies. Additionally, user studies could even be avoided altogether if a good mapping from the end-to-end lag and other basic factors to a \gls{QoE} metric can be derived. 

But this is a task for future work, as it would also involve a distinction based on some of the aforementioned game classification criteria, which have to be fleshed out and tested first.
