\section{An End-to-End Lag Model}
\label{sec:model}

It is evident from the discussion in Section \ref{sec:background} 
that multiple different components contribute to 
the end-to-end lag in games, and that multiple potential models and 
levels of granularity exist for each game type.
Let's discuss therefore the model boundaries and level of detail 
used in the current iteration of this analytical model to be presented here.

First, we define the end-to-end lag to be the time elapsed 
from when the player supplies commands to the input devices until just 
before actual audio/video output.
% I.e.: rendering, *and* encode/decode for cloud games
We assume that the actual presentation of 
audio and video content happens instantaneously  
(ignoring any screen synchronization issues), and assume the player 
input to be a stochastic process. % future work!1!!
Furthermore, as also found in practice, input events are queued up  
and sent en bloc at a specific, configurable interval.

Second, in our treatment of client-server games, we focus on modeling 
a single connected client and its interaction with the game server. 
While other clients might be connected to the same server, it is 
solely the server that controls when game state updates are sent. 
Thus, the client we are looking at does not need to account for the 
behavior of other clients.
% probaby not future work

Next, we associate a static (but individually parametrizable) tick 
rate with the computation process of the game server, and a frame rate 
with the render process. 
The server updates the state of the game world at every tick, and may 
spend some processing time in order to do so. Once finished, an update 
message is sent to the client.
Independent of the update process, the game client outputs the next 
video frame in accordance to the frame rate. The game client's state 
might not get updated by the server between rendered frames. Still, 
output is generated\footnote{A practical game implementation will use state prediction for this.}.

Note that while the delay between frames is held constant here,
the lag between an input event and the earliest frame containing a perceptible 
result of that event can take multiple frame times.

While we consider the command, tick, and frame rates to be constant 
(while not necessarily identical), there is no inherent synchronization 
between them. This is represented in the simulation by a random initial 
phase offset for each of the rates.

Finally, since we are simulating online games, the simulation obviously 
includes the network paths between the different components. The delay 
distributions are freely configurable, but may be omitted entirely as well.
Fig.~\ref{fig:queuing-model} gives a graphical representation of the model for the online video game case.

\label{fig:queuing-model}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Model simplifications}

The simulation model at hand does not attempt to capture all possible 
sources of lag that. Indeed, we simplify the model in the 
following aspects in the hope to make the results more tractable.
%\textbf{TODO Make this more of a ``future work'' section, less ``why we suck''.}

\paragraph{Additional delay sources.}
The simulation ignores, i.e. 
models as a constant zero contribution, the delays contributed by 
input devices like keyboards, mice, and game controllers. We estimate 
these at below \SI{10}{\milli\second}. The same goes for the  lag of 
the display device (from after rendering or decoding until the frame 
is actually visible) which is typically in the range of 1--3 frames for a computer 
monitor, and larger for TV sets. 
% TODO: \textbf{Add adaptive VSYNC?}

\paragraph{Subtleties of game internals.}
Modern games go great lengths 
to handle lag gracefully, and try to ``work around it'' in various ways. 
The methods for this vary, and implementations usually are not open 
for examination, so we leave them for further study. 
Techniques include lag compensation (the game client 
tries to predict the server state from past knowledge, allowing for 
smoother local updates but possibly causing slight deviation and 
re-synchronization artifacts), and tick- and framerate adaptation 
at the game server and client, respectively.
Lastly, player actions in a game might take multiple command time 
intervals to perform. The simulation currently assumes that every 
single batch of commands that reaches the server will result in 
state updates and thus changes in the perceptible output of the game 
client. It should be noted, that none of these techniques alter the 
end-to-end lag itself, rather they just try to conceal it on some higher level. 
Therefore, the mechanisms do not invalidate our examination of the basic 
end-to-end lag itself.
%\textbf{TODO I'm making this up. PLX correct.}

\paragraph{Factors in human perception and strategy.}
The lag model 
we present does not take into account the perceived lag from when the 
player \textit{thinks} they have triggered an action to when they 
perceive the outcomes of their action. This consequently disregards 
effects of different player actions (``traverse vs fight''), strategies 
(``assault vs snipe''), and so on.

\subsection{Sources of Latency in Gaming}
\label{sec:latency}


Fig.~\ref{fig:tickrate-timeseries} shows a time series attempting to exemplify this for the simplified case of an online video game.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{../models/tickrate-timeseries.pdf}
	\caption{Exemplary flow of events in online client-server game, and resulting end-to-end lag. Delay values are given for a framerate of \SI{60}{\hertz} and a server tickrate of \SI{30}{\hertz}, the network latency will only show minor variations.}
\label{fig:tickrate-timeseries}
\end{figure}



%All in all, if possible, video game measurements should always consider the full \textbf{end-to-end} lag factoring in every possible source of delay but also the presence latency compensation and concealment techniques.



% Online games attempt to compensate network latency through various means, such as already showing the results of your local inputs while waiting for the authoritative update from the server and potentially rolling back the local updates.

% TODO: Also mention lag compensation/concealment techniques:
% Client-side: non-authoritatively update game state based on own inputs and merging it afterwards with the server's view, correcting any prediction errors
% Server-side: Keep a short history of past game states, and do not execute player commands at the state they were received but rather at the (estimated) state time they were intended for.

% lag compensation can also be implemtented specifically for cloud gaming as the work conducted in \cite{Lee:2015:OUS:2742647.2742656} suggests, however incurring siginficant overhead in terms of processing time for the game logic and renderer as well as the encoding and bandwidth due to specutatively generating and transmitting frames ahead of their corresponding input.


% game keeps history of recent game state snapshots to interpolate between two server states and create a smoother experience (thus decoupling client frame rate from the server's state updates), but adds e.g. \SI{100}{\milli\second} of view lag due to snapshot history.

% Online games generally follow one of two designs. Either there is a dedicated server available to host the game, or one of the clients is elected to additionally act as the server.
% The election is typically based on criteria such as the available performance and latency. If the selected host drops out of the game, a new server has to be elected and the game gets migrated there, usually stopping the game for a few moments. Competitive games almost always choose the dedicated approach to ensure fairness, stability and better control cheats.

% \subsection{Determining Video Game Popularity and Engagement}
% FUTURE WORK!

% Using Steam data as a popularity measure and get a grasp of which games could be worthwhile to look at. Ties in to user engagement metrics to determine the quality a game delivers in a current situation. Alternative view: the more engaged players are to a game, the more important is delivering a good quality (e.g. for streaming).

% For example, there might be a correlation between a game's price and the average time it's been played, as Figure~\ref{fig:tickrate-streamed}.


% Other  k-means clustering of steam/price data or other graphs
