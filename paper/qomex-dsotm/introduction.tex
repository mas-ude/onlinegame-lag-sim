\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Recently, video games have garnered research interest from both the computer networking and the \gls{QoE} communities, both taking a look at network-related properties and the resulting \acrshort{QoS} and \gls{QoE} of individual video games. Many of these research efforts were triggered through the contrivance of cloud gaming, though the user experience of online games still remains a topic of investigation and research. A quickly growing number of publications concern themselves with assessing the \gls{QoE} of such games. These assessments are usually conducted through meticulously set up user studies in a lab environment and can produce quite fitting results.

However, the inherent diversity of games and their accompanying gameplay mechanics make it difficult to transfer any of these results from one game to another. In contrast to passively consuming videos, games are highly interactive, making the setup of meaningful quality assessment studies much more difficult. Compared to plain video streaming, underlying properties of video games are also not straight-forward to observe from the outside. Yet, in order to conduct proper measurements, it is essential to understand them. This paper aims to derive lessons learned from gaming user studies conducted in the literature and give insights into some of gaming's core properties. To further this, an \gls{E2E} lag model is introduced which represents the lag between a user input event and the display of the event's results on the screen. The model describes game lag on the basis of other intrinsic game factors, such as the framerate and tickrate. Initial results with this model confirm the influence of the framerate and tickrate on the \gls{E2E} lag and therefore also on the subjective interaction quality of the game. This means that these two parameters need to be tightly controlled in subjective quality assessment studies.
