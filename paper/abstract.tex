\begin{abstract}
The online interactions and resulting user experience of the online interaction of video games have been a topic of several publications in the past. This trend was reinforced through the development of Cloud Gaming with its strong dependence on good network conditions. Many of these studies focus on subjective user assessments, as this is usually an approach that quickly results in usable scores without going too deep into technical details of video games. Contrary, objective and \acrshort{QoS}-centric measurements are often much harder to conduct.

This paper aims to offer some insights and best practices for the realization of such objective online video game measurements. To facilitate this, we first discuss two properties intrinsic to video games which distinguish them from pure video streaming:
\begin{enumerate*} 
	\item the framerate and 
	\item the game tickrate 
\end{enumerate*}
and their impact on the game's interactivity and end-to-end lag. Derived from these properties three distinct measurement approaches and their limitations are presented.
