Recently, online and cloud video games have been shifting into the 
focus of consumer and academic interest. However, 
due to the nature of video games and their large diversity, assessments 
of subjective game quality  
are always specific to a single game, and arguably even specific to the 
exact experiment conditions, and are difficult to
transfer to any other game, even if they seem to be similar on the 
surface.

This paper aims to rectify this by providing a model for an underlying 
mechanic that is a governing property of most of such earlier results: 
The end-to-end lag of video games. The paper describes in detail the 
components of this lag model. It additionally provides a 
parametrizable simulation that calculates the lag for several typical scenarios, such as online or cloud gaming. The simulation reveals the large influence of non-network related factors on the end-to-end lag.
