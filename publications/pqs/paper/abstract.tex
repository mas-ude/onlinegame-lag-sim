\begin{abstract}
To further the knowledge of basic game mechanics and improve future video game \gls{QoE} studies we present a model and simulation for \gls{E2E} lag in networked and cloud computer games. \gls{E2E} lag describes the latency between a user's action and the display of the action's results on the screen, thus providing both a basic measure for interactivity and a fundamental parameter to derived \gls{QoE} metrics. In contrast to \gls{E2E} lag models that focus on the network \gls{RTT}, the presented work also factors in the game's tickrate and framerate (and codec latencies in the case of cloud games). This reveals side effects that can entirely mask the network delay's contribution to the total lag, an important notion to consider for future game studies.
